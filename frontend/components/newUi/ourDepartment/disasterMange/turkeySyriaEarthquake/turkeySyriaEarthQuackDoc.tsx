      <p className="text-base text-center pt-8 py-3">
        In the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria,
        FGRF swiftly mobilized to provide aid and support to those affected. Our
        comprehensive assistance included cooked food, container houses, ration
        parcels, cash aid, and essential supplies for the needy.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-center py-3">
        But our commitment did not end there. FGRF made a promise to the orphans
        and widows affected by the disasters: to provide them with homes. Today,
        we are proud to announce that we have partnered with Turkey official
        Disaster Management Department to construct 100 houses and 2 schools in
        the border areas of Turkey and Syria, providing shelter and education to
        those in need
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-center py-3">
        And that is not allâ€”FGRF has signed agreements with Turkish officials
        for the construction of over 200 additional houses and schools,
        furthering our mission to empower communities and rebuild lives.
