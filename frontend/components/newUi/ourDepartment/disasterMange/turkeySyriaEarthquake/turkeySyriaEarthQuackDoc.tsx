        FGRF Response to Turkey and Syria Earthquakes
      </h2>

      <p className="text-base text-center pt-8 py-3">
        In the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria,
        FGRF swiftly mobilized to provide aid and support to those affected.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-center pt-8 py-3">
        Our comprehensive assistance included cooked food, container houses,
        ration parcels, cash aid, and essential supplies for the needy.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-center py-3">
        But our commitment didn&#39;t end there. FGRF made a promise to the
        orphans and widows affected by the disasters: to provide them with
        homes. Today, we&#39;re proud to announce that we&#39;ve partnered with
        Turkey&#39;s official Disaster Management Department to construct 100
        houses and 2 schools in the border areas of Turkey and Syria, providing
        shelter and education to those in need.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-center py-3">
        And that&#39;s not allâ€”FGRF has signed agreements with Turkish officials
        for the construction of over 200 additional houses and schools,
        furthering our mission to empower communities and rebuild lives.
